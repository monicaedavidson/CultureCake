CultureCake
===========
This website was designed and coded by Elizabeth Rives and Monica Davidson. Lily George designed the name, "Culture Cake." 

Culture Cake is a website designed for users all over the world to submit their photos. Viewers can get a taste of each cities' up and coming trends. Users are encouraged to submit their own photos and suggest new cities/countries to add to the page. We like to consider the webpage the Tumblr/Pinterest of culture.

The main problem we came across were the city icons. We decided to use individual icons, at first, and place them at specific locations on our globe. When the broswer size was altered, the icons would become distorted and move to the incorrect location. Elizabeth fixed this by using illustator to include the icons. Another problem was the drop down menu- it got very tricky and the the mouse tended to avoid going down to the drop down menu. Also, the footer became quite difficult to implement.

However, the results came out fun and interactive. Each icon led to a different city that featured an array of photographs from that city/country.
